For a fully reproducible analysis starting from raw sequencing files R script have to be executed in numerical order starting with 1_ , scripts prefixed with X_ are currently not used. 

We follow one simple convention for executing the scripts: 
Your R session should run in the repository folder directly (in the folder that you cloned, not in 'data/' or 'R/')

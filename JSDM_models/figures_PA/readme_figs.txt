Figures from the JSDM models using presence/absence of helminths as response. Figures for beta values (environmental effect coefficients) are divided into multiple subfigures for better visualization. 
Each model includes several figures for model evaluation and four different figures of results: 
1. beta coefficients - species responses to environmental effects
2. gamma coefficients - trait responses to environmental effects
3. omega coefficients - species co-ocurrences
4. variance partitioning of the explained variance

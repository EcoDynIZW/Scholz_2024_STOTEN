Figures from the JSDM models using presence/absence of helminths as response. 

Each model includes several figures for model evaluation and four different figures of results: 
1. beta coefficients - species responses to environmental effects
2. gamma coefficients - trait responses to environmental effects
3. omega coefficients - species co-ocurrences
4. variance partitioning of the explained variance

Figures for beta values (environmental effect coefficients) and variance partitioning of hte area model are stored in the main folder "figures", as they are part of the main text of the manuscript. They are under the names "PAModel_area_BetaCoefs.png" and "PAModel_area_varpart.png", respectively.
